Facilities and Services: What's in the Lab
==========================================

The `NECSTLab`_ offers several facilities such as computing equipment, resources and services such as web hosting for small projects, code repositories.

Access to the facilities that require network connectivity is regulated by the :ref:`rules` and is granted once you obtain access to the lab (see :ref:`access`).

.. _access-facilities:

How to Obtain Access to the Computing Resources and Services
------------------------------------------------------------

When working in the lab, you are allowed to connect to the local network via wired medium (see :ref:`lan`) and reach unauthenticated services and resources. For requests involving computing resources and IT services, please email `The System Administrator`_.

Extras
~~~~~~

Need more resources or extra services?

Ask your tutor (see :ref:`tutors`) or the :ref:`radrl` and be ready to provide thorough motivation for your request. For instance, *"can I use machine X disk space for my project?"* is usually not enough. Explaining *why* you need *that* machine disk space and *which* is your project would be better in this case.

Computing Resources
-------------------

.. _lan:

Local Network

Mailing Lists and Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several mailing lists. Depending on your work area, you should request access (or you already have access) to some of or all the following:

* `NECSTLab Google Groups`_

For example, all students working in the laboratory should request access to `NECSTLab Students`_. Students working with the computer security group should request access to `NECSTLab Security`_. Both mailing lists receive emails addressed to `NECSTLab General`_ (don't request access to this list directly).

We also have a team on `NECSTLab Slack`_, an IRC-style chat system, for day to day communication. If you need access, please e-mail `The System Administrator`_ to have an account created for you, keeping your tutor or responsible faculty member in CC.

In addition to these mailing lists, join our `NECSTLab Facebook Group`_!

Code Repositories: Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can host your code in two places:

* **private (and public) repos:** on https://bitbucket.org/necst - you don't need to be part of the :kbd:`necst` team to create and use our repository. Just create a repository with your regular Bitbucket account, and transfer it to the user :kbd:`necst` from the settings of your repository. Ask `The System Administrator`_ for details.

* **public repos:** we have a GitHub account, https://github.com/necst for which you need a personal GitHub account (free).
