Facilities and Services: What's in the Lab
==========================================

The `NECSTLab`_ offers several facilities such as computing equipment, resources and services such as web hosting for small projects, code repositories.

Access to the facilities that require network connectivity is regulated by the :ref:`rules` and is granted once you obtain access to the lab (see :ref:`access`).

.. _access-facilities:

How to Obtain Access to the Computing Resources and Services
------------------------------------------------------------

When working in the lab, you are still allowed to connect to the local network via wired medium (see :ref:`lan`) and reach unauthenticated services and resources. However, most of the services and resources require authentication.

Extras
~~~~~~

Need more resources or extra services?

Ask your tutor (see :ref:`tutors`) or the :ref:`radrl` and be ready to provide thorough motivation for your request. For instance, *"can I use machine X disk space for my project?"* is usually not enough. Explaining *why* you need *that* machine disk space and *which* is your project would be better in this case.

Computing Resources
-------------------

.. _lan:

Local Network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just plug in your own computer to any available ethernet plug.

.. _wifi:

Wireless Access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just connect to "polimi", "polimi-protected" (recommended) or "eduroam" following `these instructions <https://www.connectandgo.polimi.it/en/>`_.

Registering DNS Names
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Should you need to register your :kbd:`<myname>.necst.it`, just send an email to `The System Administrator  <mailto:sysadmin@necst.it?subject=[NECSTLab]%2-DNS%20name%20request>`_


Printing
~~~~~~~~

There is a color laser printer:

* Brother DCP-L8450CDW: `drivers and instructions <http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=eu_ot&lang=en&prod=dcpl8450cdw_eu>`_.

  .. warning::
     In order not to waste paper and toner, please print on both sides of each sheet, and please limit the use of paper and toner (e.g., do not print your thesis!).

Mailing Lists and Communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are several mailing lists. Depending on your work area, you should request access (or you already have access) to some of or all the following:

* `NECSTLab Google Groups`_

For example, all students working in the laboratory should request access to `NECSTLab Students`_. Students working with the computer security group should request access to `NECSTLab Security`_. Both mailing lists receive emails addressed to `NECSTLab General`_.

We also have a team on `NECSTLab Slack`_, an IRC-style chat system, for day to day communication. If you need access, please e-mail `The System Administrator`_ to have an account created for you.

In addition to these mailing lists, join our `NECSTLab Facebook Group`_.

Code Repositories: Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can host your code in two places:

* **private repos:** on https://bitbucket.org/necst - you don't need to be part of the necst team to create and use our repository. Just create a repository with your regular Bitbucket account, and transfer it to the user :kbd:`necst` from the settings of your repository. Ask `The System Administrator`_ for details.

* **public repos:** we have a GitHub account, https://github.com/necst for which you need a personal GitHub account (free).


The NECSTCloud
--------------

We are running a beta version of a private cloud, to which you can request access by emailing `The System Administrator`_.
