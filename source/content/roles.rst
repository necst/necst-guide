Roles Within the NECSTLab
-------------------------

.. _radrl:

RADRL
^^^^^

In every research area at DEIB, one of the professors is also assigned a special role called RADRL, short for `"Responsabile delle Attivit√† Didattiche e di Ricerca nei Laboratori" <http://home.dei.polimi.it/tomasson/documenti/Elenco%20RADRL.pdf>`_.

The NECSTLab RADRL is Prof. `Marco D. Santambrogio`_.

.. _students:

Students
^^^^^^^^

There are two kinds of students: undergraduate students, or "undergrads", and graduate students (Master Students or PhD Students).

Undergraduate Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Undergraduate students in the NECSTLab usually work on course projects or on their bachelor thesis. You can recognize them because the are the youngest creatures. They usually spend 6 to 8 months in the lab.

Master Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Master students in the NECSTLab work on their master thesis and usually one or more side projects. Sometimes, master students collaborate with one or more undergrads within their thesis. You can recognize them because they believe they can rule the world. They usually spend 8 to 14 months in the lab.

PhD Students
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PhD students in the NECSTLab work on a 3 to 4-years research project and in plenty of side projects. PhD students collaborate with other PhD students and, normally, with one or more master students. You can recognize them because they spend most of their time in the lab. They are involved in teaching activities from time to time.


.. _ras:

Research Assistants
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Research assistants comprise post-doctorate researchers and temporary researchers.

Post-doctorate Researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Post-doctorate researchers hold a PhD degree, and are in the NECSTLab to continue working on their research. You can recognize them because they think that they have the authority to whip every student in the lab with an ever-increasing amount of work.

Temporary Researchers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Temporary researchers have been hired by a professor to work on one or more research project. You can recognize them because they work hard, and party harder. They could be involved in teaching activities.

.. _faculty-members:

Faculty Members
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Members of the Faculty of Politecnico di Milano are what you usually would refer to as "professors".

Assistant Professors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Assistant professors are the youngest, and they work in the NECSTLab closely with students. They are responsible of directing several research projects and some of the lab's activities. You can recognize them because they work on research project proposals, (several) papers, and (several) teaching courses.

Associate Professors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Associate professors work with the NECSTLab's assistant professors and they are responsible for directing several research projects and teaching activities. You can recognize them from their long funding and publication records.


Full Professors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Full professors work with the NECSTLab's assistant and associate professors and they are responsible for several research projects and teaching activities. You can recognize them because, when you skim through their CV, you hurt your mouse wheel for excessive page scrolling.
